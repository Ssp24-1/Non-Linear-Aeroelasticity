# Non-Linear-Aeroelasticity
Repository contains codes to showcase and model the physics and visuals of Non-linear Aeroelastic Pheomena. More will be added as code is completed. Please read the attached text/report for theoretical and mathematical undersanding.

1. Cubic Stiffness of 2D Airfoil Section
2. Stability Osicllators


Self-made Python code of a few important examples from the Theory of Nonlinear Aeroelasticity from the book (Introduction to Non Linear Aeroelasticity by Grigorios Dimitriadis). 

It covers multiple topics from the book in no specific order. Comments in the code will inform you modifications that can be made to test out various configurations.

** No code was copied or taken directly from the book by any means. Programs were completely self made by viewing and solving the example problems by hand after which, it was converted into python code. Any similarities with the code from the textbook is purely coincidental.
